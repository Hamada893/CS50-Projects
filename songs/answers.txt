Characterizing the listener's aura :

- Energy: if the energy is high it might indicate the listener enjoys this song and might repeat it

- Valence: higher valence equals more positive emotions which if we take into account the next type of characterization "danceabaility" could bump the song even higher in the listener's favorites

- Danceability: higher danceability could result in the listener enjoying the song even more and thus liking it

Potential FLaws:

- Narrow number of songs - only 100 - thus might not capture what the listener likes overall

- If the user went through emotional instability or a "phase" it could skew all of the data

How to make it better:

- Include more than 100 songs

- Personalize over time not only in one specific year - in this case 2018 - like Spotify does
